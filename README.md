# Inheritance-its-Types
Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows one class to inherit the properties and behavior of another class. The class that is being inherited from is called the parent or superclass, while the class that is doing the inheriting is called the child or subclass.
